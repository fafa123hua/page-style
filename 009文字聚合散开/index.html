        Ladies and Gentlemen.Never before have we had so many different ways to
        talk to one another.In the distant past, written documents would be
        carried by hand across thousands of miles from China to Western
        Europe.Today, we access knowledge from all over the world, through our
        mobile phones and at a tap of the key.
